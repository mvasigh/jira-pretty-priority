# `jira-sane-priority`
Chrome extension that makes Jira's priority arrows more easily discernable from one another.

## Example

<p align="center">
  <img src="./old.png" height="250" />
  <br />
  <em>Old: difficult to distinguish from one another</em>
</p>
  
Jira's standard arrows for priority level are hard to tell apart because they are close in color and don't have any other    characteristics, such as arrow direction.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./new.png" height="250" />
  <br />
  <em>New: easier to scan and identify high-priority tickets</em>
</p>

This extension fixes the issue by applying appropriate rotations and de-emphasizing medium-to-low-priority issues.
